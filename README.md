# PHP2650 Final Project

${\color{gray}Posted: 05/10/2024}$

This is the complete repository, including both text and video, for the final project of PHP 2550 Practical Data Analysis course at Brown University (Spring 24).

In this project, our aim is to delve into the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) approach introduced in the paper [*Continuous control With deep reinforcement learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) by Timothy P. Lillicrap et al. To facilitate comprehension, we commence with a concise introduction to reinforcement learning (RL), followed by an exploration of various RL algorithms, with a particular focus on two pivotal ones incorporated in the development of DDPG: the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm and the Deep Q Network (DQN). Subsequently, we elucidate how the DDPG approach is formulated and examine its diverse applications. These explanations are presented both through textual descriptions and accompanying video demonstrations.
