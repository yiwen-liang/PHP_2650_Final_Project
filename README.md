# PHP2650 Final Project

${\color{gray}Posted: 05/10/2024}$

This is the complete repository, including both text and video, for the final project of PHP 2650 Statistical Learning and Big Data course at Brown University (Spring 24).

In this project, our aim is to delve into the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) approach introduced in the paper [*Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) by Timothy P. Lillicrap et al. To facilitate comprehension, we commence with a concise introduction to reinforcement learning (RL), followed by an exploration of various RL algorithms, with a particular focus on two pivotal ones incorporated in the development of DDPG: the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm and the Deep Q Network (DQN). Subsequently, we elucidate how the DDPG approach is formulated and examine its diverse applications. These explanations are presented both through textual descriptions and accompanying video demonstrations.

### Guidelines

* *xxx.pdf*: the explainations of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) approach in text.

* *Video Presentation*: the explainations of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) approach through presentation. The slides are created using *Prezi* and we add an voice over to it to create this short presentation. Contrained by the size of the video file, we're not able to directly upload it in this Github post, and the video can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TZLXkOSE62LYvV1SI7H1rE8Ym7c5YzLn/view?usp=drive_link) in Google Drive. We also mentioned an YouTube video in our presentation as an example of the application but cannot play it in our presentation due to copyright reasons, the original video that teaches a robot to walk using DDPG can be watched on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFXp2Ro-10).
